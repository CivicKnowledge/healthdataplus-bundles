# Caveats and Limitations

The estimates in this dataset are based on the 2011-2012 CHIS survey, with population estimates initially drawn 
from the 2008-2012 ACS. The population values were then adjusted to match the CHIS survey design, so they will differ
from the population estimates in the ACS.
